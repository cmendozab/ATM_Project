You will require to start a webserver in order to view the result on your computer. You can try any of the commonly available webservers.
There are three options in a selector: Null, Deposit, and Cash Back. Each one of these options renders a different view on the browser. If we want to make a deposit then select Deposit. If we would like to make a withdrawal, then choose Cash Back. 

The total amount displayed at the top of the browser will show the total amount remaining in the account after each operation.
If there is not enough funds in your account then the Submit button will become disabled.
If you chose the Null option in the selector nothing appears on the lower part of the browser.
